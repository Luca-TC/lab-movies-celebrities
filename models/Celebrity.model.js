/*Iteration #2: The Celebrity model
Our first step is to create the Celebrity model and add some celebrities in our database.

The Celebrity model should have:

name - String (like Tom Cruise, Beyonce, Daffy Duck, etc.)
occupation - String (what the celebrity does, why they are famous. 
    For example actor,singer, comedian, or you can put unknown if your celebrity is someone like Kim Kardashian)
catchPhrase - String (every celebrity needs a good catch phrase.
    Well maybe not all of them have one in real life, but all of our celebrities will have a catch phrase.
        This can be pretty much anything.)
Go ahead and locate the Celebrity.model.js model file in the models folder. 
Using schema,
create the Celebrity model with the above mentioned properties. Don't forget to export the model. 2.
